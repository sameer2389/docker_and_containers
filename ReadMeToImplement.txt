Step 3: In the directry whrere the services are written , cretae a docker compose yml file.

Step 4:Go to the powershell and navigate to the the directory you have downloaded the code into.

Step 5: Run docker-compose buld followed by up and down to bring the services up or down.

Step 6:Go throug the code to see on what it is doing. Fairly easy code is provided to understand the concepts.
